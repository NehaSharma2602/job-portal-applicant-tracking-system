<h3>## Modules</h3>

### 1. Role Module </br>
Defines user types in the system. </br>
- Roles — `ADMIN`, `RECRUITER`, `CANDIDATE` </br>

### 2. User Module </br>
Manages login credentials and basic information for every person in the system. Every person must be registered as a User with a Role assigned.</br>

### 3. Company Module</br>
Manages companies that post jobs. Supports active/inactive status for soft delete. One Company can have Many Jobs.</br>

### 4. Job Module</br>
Manages job postings by companies with details like title, salary, required skills and experience. Jobs have status — `OPEN`, `CLOSED`, `ON_HOLD`, `FILLED`. Only OPEN jobs accept applications.</br>

**Job Types:** `FULL_TIME` `PART_TIME` `CONTRACT` `INTERNSHIP` `FREELANCE` `REMOTE`</br>

### 5. Candidate Module</br>
Manages candidate profiles linked to user accounts. One User maps to exactly One Candidate (OneToOne). Supports filtering by location, gender and experience level.</br>

### 6. Resume Module </br>
Candidates can upload multiple resumes. One resume can be marked as default which is auto-selected when applying for jobs. Switching default automatically removes it from the previous one. </br>

### 7. Application Module </br>
Candidates apply for jobs using their resume with an optional cover letter. Prevents duplicate applications to the same job. Job must be OPEN to accept applications. </br>

**Application Status Flow:** </br>
APPLIED → UNDER_REVIEW → SHORTLISTED → SELECTED </br>
↓
REJECTED
### 8. Interview Module</br>
Interviews are scheduled only for SHORTLISTED applications. Multiple rounds can be scheduled per application. Recruiter updates result and feedback after the interview.</br>

**Interview Result Flow:**
PENDING → PASSED
→ FAILED
→ CANCELLED
